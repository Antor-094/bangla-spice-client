            A controlled component is a component that is controlled by its
            parent component through props, while an uncontrolled component is a
            component that manages its own internal state. In a controlled form
            input, the parent component sets the value and handles any changes
            to the value, while in an uncontrolled form input, the input manages
            its own state and handles any changes to its value. Controlled
            components offer more precise control over the component's behavior,
            while uncontrolled components can be more convenient for simple use
            cases.
